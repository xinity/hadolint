A smarter Dockerfile linter that helps you build [best practice Docker images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/articles/dockerfile_best-practices/).
The linter is parsing the Dockerfile into an AST and performs rules on top of the AST.
It is standing on the shoulders of [Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) to lint the Bash
code inside `RUN` instructions.

## How to use

You can run `hadolint` locally to lint your Dockerfile.

```bash
hadolint <Dockerfile>
hadolint --ignore DL3003 --ignore DL3006 <Dockerfile> # exclude specific rules
```

Docker comes to the rescue to provide an easy way how to run `hadolint` on most platforms.
Just pipe your `Dockerfile` to `docker run`:

```
docker run --rm -i lukasmartinelli/hadolint < Dockerfile
```

## Install

You can [**download prebuilt binaries for OSX, Windows and Linux from the latest release page**](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/releases/latest
). However they may not run on your system configuration since I am not able to provide completly staticly linked binaries. Fall back to `brew`, source installation or Docker if it doesn't work for you.

If you are on OSX you can use [brew](http://brew.sh/) to install hadolint.

```bash
brew install hadolint
```

You can also build `hadolint` locally. You need [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) and
the [stack build tool](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade.html) to build the binary.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint
cd hadolint
stack build
```

## Rules

Incomplete list of implemented rules. Click on the error code to get more detailed information.

- Rules with the prefix `DL` originate from **hadolint**. Take a look into `Rules.hs` to find the implementation of the rules.
- Rules with the `SC` prefix originate from **ShellCheck** (Only the most common rules are listed, there are dozens more)

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/issues/new) if you have an idea for a good rule.

| Rule                                                              | Description
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| [DL3000](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/wiki/DL3000) | Use absolute WORKDIR.
| [DL3001](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/wiki/DL3001) | For some bash commands it makes no sense running them in a Docker container like ssh, vim, shutdown, service, ps, free, top, kill, mount, ifconfig.
| [DL3002](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/wiki/DL3002) | Do not switch to root USER.

| [DL3007](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/wiki/DL3007) | Using latest is prone to errors if the image will ever update. Pin the version explicitly to a release tag.
| [DL3006](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/wiki/DL3006) | Always tag the version of an image explicitly.
| [DL3008](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/wiki/DL3008) | Pin versions in apt get install.

| [DL3015](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/wiki/DL3015) | Avoid additional packages by specifying --no-install-recommends.
| [DL3020](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/wiki/DL3020) | Use `COPY` instead of `ADD` for files and folders.
| [DL4000](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/wiki/DL4000) | Specify a maintainer of the Dockerfile.
| [DL4001](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/wiki/DL4001) | Either use Wget or Curl but not both.

| [SC1000](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1000)      | `$` is not used specially and should therefore be escaped.
| [SC1001](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1001)      | This `\c` will be a regular `'c'`  in this context.
| [SC1007](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1007)      | Remove space after `=` if trying to assign a value (or for empty string, use `var='' ...`).
| [SC1010](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1010)      | Use semicolon or linefeed before `done` (or quote to make it literal).
| [SC1018](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1018)      | This is a unicode non-breaking space. Delete it and retype as space.
| [SC1035](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1035)      | You need a space here
| [SC1045](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1045)      | It's not `foo &; bar`, just `foo & bar`.
| [SC1065](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1065)      | Trying to declare parameters? Don't. Use `()` and refer to params as `$1`, `$2` etc.
| [SC1066](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1066)      | Don't use $ on the left side of assignments.
| [SC1068](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1068)      | Don't put spaces around the `=` in assignments.
| [SC1077](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1077)      | For command expansion, the tick should slant left (\` vs Â´).
| [SC1078](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1078)      | Did you forget to close this double quoted string?
| [SC1079](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1079)      | This is actually an end quote, but due to next char it looks suspect.
| [SC1081](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1081)      | Scripts are case sensitive. Use `if`, not `If`.
| [SC1083](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1083)      | This `{/}` is literal. Check expression (missing `;/\n`?) or quote it.
| [SC1086](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1086)      | Don't use `$` on the iterator name in for loops.
| [SC1087](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1087)      | Braces are required when expanding arrays, as in `${array[idx]}`.
| [SC1095](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1095)      | You need a space or linefeed between the function name and body.
| [SC1097](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1097)      | Unexpected `==`. For assignment, use `=`. For comparison, use `[/[[`.
| [SC1098](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1098)      | Quote/escape special characters when using `eval`, e.g. `eval "a=(b)"`.
| [SC1099](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC1099)      | You need a space before the `#`.
| [SC2002](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2002)      | Useless cat. Consider `cmd < file | ..` or `cmd file | ..` instead.
| [SC2015](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2015)      | Note that `A && B || C` is not if-then-else. C may run when A is true.
| [SC2026](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2026)      | This word is outside of quotes. Did you intend to 'nest '"'single quotes'"' instead'?
| [SC2028](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2028)      | `echo` won't expand escape sequences. Consider `printf`.
| [SC2035](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2035)      | Use `./*glob*` or `-- *glob*` so names with dashes won't become options.
| [SC2046](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2046)      | Quote this to prevent word splitting
| [SC2086](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2086)      | Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting.
| [SC2140](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2140)      | Word is on the form `"A"B"C"` (B indicated). Did you mean `"ABC"` or `"A\"B\"C"`?
| [SC2154](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2154)      | var is referenced but not assigned.
| [SC2164](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2164)      | Use `cd ... || exit` in case `cd` fails.


## Develop

This is my first Haskell program. If you are a experienced Haskeller I would be really thankful
if you would tear my code apart in a review.

### Setup

1. Clone repository
    ```bash
    git clone --recursive git@github.com:lukasmartinelli/hadolint.git
    ```
2. Install the dependencies
    ```bash
    stack install
    ```

### REPL

The easiest way to try out the parser is using the REPL.

```bash
# start the repl
stack repl
# parse instruction and look at AST representation
parseString "FROM debian:jessie"
```

### Tests

Run unit tests.

```bash
stack test
```

Run integration tests.

```
./integration_test.sh
```

### Parsing

The Dockerfile is parsed using [Parsec](https://wiki.haskell.org/Parsec) and is using the lexer `Lexer.hs` and parser `Parser.hs`.

### AST

Dockerfile syntax is is fully described in the [Dockerfile reference](http://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).  Just take a look at `Syntax.hs` to see the AST definition.
